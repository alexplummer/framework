# The Feature Creep Framework
**This is the personal framework of Alex Plummer and it includes probably every Gulp package under the sun. It uses a Pug, SASS and CouchCMS stack which works really well for me, perhaps you won't need everything in here...**
---
## Main tech stack
Here are the main languages which are used:
* Pug is used for HTML [https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html)
* SASS is used for the CSS [http://sass-lang.com/](http://sass-lang.com/)
* CouchCMS is used for the backend [https://www.couchcms.com/](https://www.couchcms.com/)
* There are four seperate flavours for JS: ES5, ES6, Angular or React
* This all runs through a highly configured Gulp file

### Some of the features
There is a ton going on in this framework, however these are some of the key features: 
* Lightweight, design orientated framework with no bloat or excessive collections of elements
* A modular and responsive scale for type and sizes all based off of the baseline
* Use of a flexbox grid system constructed through SASS placeholders to minimise bloat
* Auto-injection of your SASS, JS, Bower dependencies (plus their assets) and Fontello all into a super simple folder structure
* Fast work environment with BrowserSync injections and asynchronous setup of Gulp tasks
* Streamlined output with asset minification and optimisation along with Critical CSS, UnCSS and image sprite maps
* Generated lint reports for JS and CSS along with error toaster notifications, PSI and accessibilty reports
* NGrok tunnels and Gulp FTP for testing and demos 
* CouchCMS integration with Gulp to compile Pug templates into PHP assets
